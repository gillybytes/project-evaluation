### License

1. What is the project's license? In most repositories there will be a file named LICENSE or something similar in the root level of the repository. This is the one to examine. There may be different licenses on specific files, but the project will have a main license.
   Blender uses the GNU General Public License. This license describes the rights to distribute or change the code.

### Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?
      The primary programming language for Blender is C.


1. What is the development environment? For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install?
   The Development environment is in C/C++ as well as some of it being in Python. They say that having a background in these should suffice. As for the installation of blender, they have easy to find instructions in their user manual with links to multiple instructions depending on your operating system.

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries?
   Blender requires that all of it's code and commits be in particular format. This format is called Clang format. In their Development Environment guide they elaborate more on Clang format through a link and give instructions on how to set it up. For windows and mac it comes as a default and for linux they give simple and easy instructions on how to set it up

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample.
   Yes, most of the source code files are fairly easy to understand. The variables and codes are clear and readable.

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/).
   Yes, this is a big project. There are a total of 2.13 million lines of code (as of last month).


1. Does the repository have tests?
   Yes, there is a tests folder that contains many testable codes.

### Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself?
   The code is really clear because they have a particular format (Clang Format) that they all use when making commits.


1. Is there documentation about the design?
   Yes, there was multiple documentation that was focused on making the code more readable and the neatness of the program.

### Activity Level


1. How many commits have been made in the past week?
   Within the past week, there have been a total of 336 commits. There were 136 commits to the master branch and 230 commits to all branches.

1. When was the most recent commit?
   The most recent commit was at 8:00 AM EST on February 27, 2020.

1. How many issues are currently open?
   There are currently 1749 open tasks in the issue tracker. 700 are open and labeled as bugs.

1. How long do issues stay open?
Take the five most recently closed issues and look at when each was first reported.
Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
   The issues that are opened can range anywhere between a few weeks to one or two(sometimes more) months to be closed. The few that I looked over would usually take around a month to be closed.


1. Is there active discussion on the issues?
Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues.
   Yes, there are active discussions that I’ve seen throughout the issue tracker. Most issues are addressed within a day maybe two and the conversations that are had on these issues can continue through the months until they are finally closed.

1. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.?
   There did not seem to be many ways of searching for easy issues to take care of. The only way I can imagine doing so would be to search open issues that are low on their list of priorities and that doesn’t seem very accurate. Either way, many of the bugs and issues with blender don’t seem very beginner friendly. 

1. How many issues were closed in the past six months?
   451 issues were closed in the last 6 months


1. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project?
   According to Blender’s contributors page, there are roughly about 100 people who have committed, added and deleted within the project.

1. How many contributors has the project had in the past six months?
   Since September, there have been about 33 contributors.


1. How many open pull requests are there?
   It is difficult to tell how many pull requests there are because we were unable to find any pull requests through the platform that holds their repository. However, we believe that the **open revisions** category is their version of pull requests. The oldest open open revision was created on January 27, 2014 and the most recent open revision was created on March 1.

1. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time?
Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open.
Take the five most recently closed ones and look at when each was first reported.
Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
   Open revisions do not remain unanswered for long at all; in fact, they are usually answered within the same day.

1. Is there active discussion on the pull requests?
Use the same method as you did for the issues.
   There is more active discussion on accepted open revisions in comparison to open revisions that need review or are closed.

1. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months?
   There were roughly around 145 open revisions opened within the past six months.


1. When was the last  pull request  merged?
   The last request was merged around a month ago. It seems that commits happen over a longer period of time.

### Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough.
   There is no CONTRIBUTING document found within the actual repository; however, there is a contribute section on their official webpage. It is easy to read and understand as they provide resourceful links. 

1. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
violte it?
   There is no CODE OF CONDUCT document, so it is difficult to tell if there are any consequences.

1. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
Are responses generally constructive?
Read the issue conversations.
   They often times are very quick and are helpful when they do. 

1. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat?
   The issue responses are more focused and less quick. Like I mentioned before, issues don’t seem to be as user friendly. The Tone in the forums however was extremely friendly and very welcoming. They also gave long and in depth responses.

1. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?
   Often. In many of the Forum discussions on issues and implementations I noticed that a lot of the forums posts would end with a friendly thanks for the work that the contributor had done.

### Summary
Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the
course of a semester?
* No, we would not be interested in possibly contributing to this project. We had a difficult time navigating through their repository, and was unable to evaluate things thoroughly. Evidently, there were issues finding pull requests and the issue tracker. They also do not provide a handful of the important documentation, which we believe is necessary.


### installing Process
   I have completed the installing process and it was tough. I found that finding the instructions for the manual installation was difficult because although they have a instructions on how to build it, it took some time to find it through navigation. It was also my first time manually setting up a program. Usually an installer that is provided is the easier route. However, I understand that I would need the ability to do this when contributing.
