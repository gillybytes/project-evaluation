### Summary
*Do you think this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the
course of a semester?*

    Yes, I think this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the course of a semester. There are suggestions available for how to contribute to this project [here](https://opencv.org/about/#Contribute). The community is very active is prompt in responding to issues and pull requests. However, I am not sure this project is beginner-friendly. Issues are not tagged by difficulty and the subject of this project is complex. Also, there is no Code of Conduct. Although contributors seem polite in the discussion, there is no guarantee to a harassment-free environment.  Making a contribution would have a great impact as this project is employed by well-established companies (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Toyota, and Honda) as well as many startups.
